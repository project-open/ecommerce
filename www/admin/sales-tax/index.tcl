In general, you must collect sales tax on orders shipped to states
where you have some kind of physical presence, e.g., a warehouse, a
sales office, or a retail store.  

Some sources of data on sales tax rates by zip codes are: 
<ul>
<li><a href=\"http://www.salestax.com\">www.salestax.com</a> - their Sales Tax Assistant - All States, Single User was \$1,650 as of 3/8/2004.
<li><a href=\"http://www.simpova.com\">www.simpova.com</a> - approximately 99.95 for a national, by zip, tax table or online lookup.
</ul>

We tried to keep this module simple by ignoring the ugly fact of local
taxing jurisdictions (e.g., that New York City collects tax on top of
what New York State collects).  If you're a Fortune 500 company with
nexus in 50 states, you'll probably have to add in a fair amount of
complexity to collect tax more precisely or at least <em>remit</em>
sales tax more precisely.
