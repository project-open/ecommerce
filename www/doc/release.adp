  <h2>Features</h2>

  <p>The goal of this release was to bring the ACS 3x ecommerce
    module' s features to an ACS 4x package.  You can find a feature
    summary in the <a href="ecommerce-features">Features of the
    Ecommerce Module</a> document.

    <p>Keep in mind that this release isn't a redesign of
    @package_name@ to take advantage of all of ACS 4x new features.
    It doesn't have multiple retailer handling, nor can package be
    mounted in multiple instances in the site-map and work correctly.
    For now, those whose needs are satisfied by the functionality of
    the old ecommerce module, but want to move to ACS 4x, should be
    happy.  To everybody who wants something more, we would love your
    contributions of code!  Please see the <a
    href="http://openacs.org/sdm/">OpenACS SDM</a> to report bugs
    (patches always welcome) or make feature requests.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://openacs.org/software/">OpenACS</a></li>
	
    <li>Optional: <a href="http://arsdigita.com/acs-repository/">Site
	Wide Search Package (4.0.1)</a> and all its dependencies if
	you want to incorporate products into Site Wide Search
  </ul>

  <h2>Known Issues</h2>

  <p>As this is an alpha release there are a few things that still
    need to be fixed.</p>

  <ul> 
    
    <li>A number of auditing inserts are not working.</li>

    <li>The optional Site Wide Search interface results in the
      following error when a trying to rebuild the index after a new
      ec_product object has been created (ECOM_4X_DEV was the oracle
      user name):
      <blockquote>
	<code>
	<pre>
	ERR_INDEX_NAME		       ERR_TIMEST ERR_TEXTKEY

	DRG-12604: execution of user datastore procedure has failed
	DRG-50857: oracle error in drsinopen

	ORA-06512: at "ECOM_4X_DEV.SWS_SERVICE", line 260
	</pre>
      </code>
      </blockquote>

      <p>I'm pretty sure that the bug is actually in the SWS code, not
	@package_name@. (<a href="mailto:wtem@olywa.net">wtem@olywa.net</a>)</p>

    <li><a href="ecommerce-technical">Technical documentation</a> is
      still a little rough.  You should be able to get things working
      with the documentation as is.  It doesn't cover how to find,
      download, and install a package.  I suspect all that is needed
      here is a link to an adequate document, but I haven't had a
      chance to find it yet.  If you have questions please email <a
      href="mailto:wtem@olywa.net">wtem@olywa.net</a>.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>We welcome any bugs fixes for any of these problems, please
    contact <a href="mailto:wtem@olywa.net">wtem@olywa.net</a> if you
    come up with fixes and/or visit the <a
